<b>Development with angular-phonecat</b>

The following docs describe how you can test and develop this application further.

<b>Installing Dependencies</b>

The application relies upon various JS libraries, such as AngularJS and jQuery, and Node.js tools, such as Karma and Protractor. You can install these by running:

`npm install`

This will also download the AngularJS files needed for the current step of the tutorial and copy them to app/lib.

Most of the scripts described below will run this automatically but it doesn't do any harm to run it whenever you like.

Note copying the AngularJS files from node_modules to app/lib makes it easier to serve the files by a web server.

Running the Application during Development
Run npm start.
Navigate your browser to http://localhost:8000/ to see the application running.
